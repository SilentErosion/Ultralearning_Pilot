<!-- 
For syntax, I'll organize it in a way that accords with actual need in a text file. 
For the others, I will find the root problem and solving ideas of each concept and try to formalize the ideas into the concepts. 
I'll try to explain before reading if I have already heard about it. If all I explained is contained in the way I imagined, I will skip that topic. 
If not, I will make a thought process that can naturally induce the information and memorize the process with mnemonic techniques.

# Concrete Goals and Evaluation Criteria
<!-- 
1. Make it fun.
2. Make it specific, measurable, provable.
3. Make it last.
-->
Briefly go over other chapters of the book: 
- [ ] 1. Test before reading: Start with asking question to abstract the concept, read as little as possible, and make them into concise mental images. Check if I can recall most of them with free recall and my mental images. Add to anki if necessary.

# Archiving Template
<!-- The main points are not to cheat myself that I understood when I actually didn't, and review my thought process. So try to include at least these: -->
### 1. The approaches/strategies I used and why

### 2. The proof that I reached the goal

### 3. If not, what I did to make amends + re-evaluation till I do.
