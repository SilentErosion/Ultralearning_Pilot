<!-- 
For syntax, I'll organize it in a way that accords with actual need in a text file. 
For the others, I will find the root problem and solving ideas of each concept and try to formalize the ideas into the concepts. 
I'll try to explain before reading if I have already heard about it. If all I explained is contained in the way I imagined, I will skip that topic. 
If not, I will make a thought process that can naturally induce the information and memorize the process with mnemonic techniques.

3. Make it last.

- [X] 1. Solve exercises on the book based on my understanding.
I managed to solve all but one problem going back and forth. That just means that there is not much to understand but memorize. I guess some more retrieval practice would be enough for now.
