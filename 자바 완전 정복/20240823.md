<!-- 
For syntax, I'll organize it in a way that accords with actual need in a text file. 
For the others, I will find the root problem and solving ideas of each concept and try to formalize the ideas into the concepts. 
I'll try to explain before reading if I have already heard about it. If all I explained is contained in the way I imagined, I will skip that topic. 
If not, I will make a thought process that can naturally induce the information and memorize the process with mnemonic techniques.

# Concrete Goals and Evaluation Criteria
<!-- 
1. Make it fun.
2. Make it specific, measurable, provable.
3. Make it last.
-->
- [x] 1. Solve problems in the book about the topic that I thought I already knew. Validate my answer with executing actual code or a solution.
- [ ] 2. Question-Book method of what I learned new yesterday. Come up with decent retrieval strategies and memorize them.
# Archiving Template
<!-- The main points are not to cheat myself that I understood when I actually didn't, and review my thought process. So try to include at least these: -->
### 1. The approaches/strategies I used and why
All of them are solved by direct recall.
### 2. The proof that I reached the goal
Only in my mind.
### 3. If not, what I did to make amends + re-evaluation till I do.
