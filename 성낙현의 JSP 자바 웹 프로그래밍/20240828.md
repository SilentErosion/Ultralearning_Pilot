<!--
In the first reading, I will go from the start to the end summarizing the language-specific features, and generalizing the overall model and concepts regarding the server, which I will memorize using mnemonics. Next, I will make review problems using the examples in the book to evaluate my understanding. If needed, I will read again some particular parts of the book, not the entire book. Then I will solve the review problems to check my mental model.

# Concrete Goals and Evaluation Criteria
<!-- 
1. Make it fun.
2. Make it specific, measurable, provable.
3. Make it last.
-->
The main goals of today are to check my understanding.  
The best way is to code and debug, which is not applicable at the moment. I searched Google how to check my understanding but none of them seemed easily applicable. I thought the best I can do for now is to make mental images that sum up the things I read. So that I can easily/efficiently review until I actually start to make real programs and verify my understanding again.
- [x] 1. Pseudo-code the online forum in the book. It must include: 1) Overall structure of the web server, 2) Data flow from the user to the server application, 3) pseudo-code of each function (CRUD, auth).
- [ ] 2. Abstract how file upload/download is done in web servers with what I read in the book. Search for how other languages do it to verify my abstraction.
- [ ] 3. Explain how login/logout, remember id, no pop-up for one day, and stay logged-in work with cookies and sessions. But in principle. Ask why for every explanation.
- [ ] 4. Write what I know about DTO, DAO, dynamic query, SQL injection and input validation(sanitization). Compare them with the book and some online search results.

# Archiving Template
The main points are not to cheat myself that I understood when I actually didn't, and review my thought process. So try to include at least these:
### 1. The approaches/strategies I used to achieve the goals and why
### 2. The proof that I reached the goal = ????
### 3. If not, what I did to make amends + re-evaluation till I do.
