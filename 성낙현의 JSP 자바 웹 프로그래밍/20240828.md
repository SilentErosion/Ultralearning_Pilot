<!--
In the first reading, I will go from the start to the end summarizing the language-specific features, and generalizing the overall model and concepts regarding the server, which I will memorize using mnemonics. Next, I will make review problems using the examples in the book to evaluate my understanding. If needed, I will read again some particular parts of the book, not the entire book. Then I will solve the review problems to check my mental model.

# Concrete Goals and Evaluation Criteria
<!-- 
1. Make it fun.
2. Make it specific, measurable, provable.
3. Make it last.
-->
The main goals of today are to check my understanding, to generalize or abstract it, and to evaluate/develop my mental images.  
But how do I make it measurable and provable? The original goals were making abstractions of functionalities and the basic concepts beneath them.  
What would be the tasks that I can prove I understood? And how am I going to make it last?
- [ ] 1. 
- [ ] 2. 
- [ ] 3.

# Archiving Template
The main points are not to cheat myself that I understood when I actually didn't, and review my thought process. So try to include at least these:
### 1. The approaches/strategies I used and why = Why I chosed my mental images as they are + What my retrieval strategies are for those
### 2. The proof that I reached the goal = ????
### 3. If not, what I did to make amends + re-evaluation till I do.
