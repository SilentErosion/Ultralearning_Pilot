<!--
In the first reading, I will go from the start to the end summarizing the language-specific features, and generalizing the overall model and concepts regarding the server, which I will memorize using mnemonics. Next, I will make review problems using the examples in the book to evaluate my understanding. If needed, I will read again some particular parts of the book, not the entire book. Then I will solve the review problems to check my mental model.

# Concrete Goals and Evaluation Criteria
<!-- 
1. Make it fun.
2. Make it specific, measurable, provable.
3. Make it last.
-->
- [ ] Finish reading the rest of the book: Focus on abstractions/generalizations so that I can infer as much as I can with thinking, not just a specific memory. Make questions for retrieval tests.
      Start with the questions before reading. Make inferences and check if they are right. If not, figure out which one I got wrong.

# Archiving Template
The main points are not to cheat myself that I understood when I actually didn't, and review my thought process. So try to include at least these:
### 1. The approaches/strategies I used and why
### 2. The proof that I reached the goal
### 3. If not, what I did to make amends + re-evaluation till I do.
