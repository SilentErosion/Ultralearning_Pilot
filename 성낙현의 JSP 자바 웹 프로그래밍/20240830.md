<!--
In the first reading, I will go from the start to the end summarizing the language-specific features, and generalizing the overall model and concepts regarding the server, which I will memorize using mnemonics. Next, I will make review problems using the examples in the book to evaluate my understanding. If needed, I will read again some particular parts of the book, not the entire book. Then I will solve the review problems to check my mental model.

# Concrete Goals and Evaluation Criteria
<!-- 
1. Make it fun.
2. Make it specific, measurable, provable.
3. Make it last.
-->

The main goal of today is to check how I retrieval strategy, to develop it, and to make better mental images to make the reviews in the future easier.
- [ ] ~~1. Abstract MVC online forum example code and make according mental images. Crosscheck with my notes I wrote yesterday.~~

It seems that there is not much to memorize if I correctly understood what MVC pattern is. The details depend upon the specifics and it doesn't seem to be efficient to memorize all the details at this point where I don't know the language and where I don't need to actually implement it. What I am still confused is that in the book, DAO is directly used in the controller but many others say that DAO is an abstraction of the data source and it should only be used within the model, not the controller. I think the logic is pretty same but using the term DAO was the source of the confusion. It just calls a method in the DAO, which is pretty much same as calling a method in the model. However it might not be the same if there are multiple data source, unlike the book only used DB for the source.
