From here, I'll rather follow the book rather than making my own practices and going over the details. Or even just skip the practices unless necessary. [^1]

# Ch5 Database
1. Config the settings in web.xml and connect to the database using JDBC driver.
2. Create a connection pool consisting of at least 5 connection objects.

[^1]: The reason of this change is: 1) There's not much time to go all over the details. 2) It's not really what I planned in the first place. 3) I'll probably have to learn again if I change the language or the framework.
