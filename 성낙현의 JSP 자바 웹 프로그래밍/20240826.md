<!--
In the first reading, I will go from the start to the end summarizing the language-specific features, and generalizing the overall model and concepts regarding the server, which I will memorize using mnemonics. Next, I will make review problems using the examples in the book to evaluate my understanding. If needed, I will read again some particular parts of the book, not the entire book. Then I will solve the review problems to check my mental model.

# Concrete Goals and Evaluation Criteria
<!-- 
1. Make it fun.
2. Make it specific, measurable, provable.
3. Make it last.

The goal of today is to check whether I understood well what I read yesterday, and try the specific tasks of using JSP.
- [ ] 1. Set up the environment for the practice.
- [ ] 2. Turn practices into exercises. Make sure to include techlnical information so that I can focus on actual learning.
- [ ] 3. Do the same things I did on 24th and in the above.

# Archiving Template
The main points are not to cheat myself that I understood when I actually didn't, and review my thought process. So try to include at least these:
### 1. The approaches/strategies I used and why
### 2. The proof that I reached the goal
### 3. If not, what I did to make amends + re-evaluation till I do.
