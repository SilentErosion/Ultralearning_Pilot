# Reflections on What I Wanted to Try
1. *Develop an effective way to use mnemonics skills to the actual learning, specifically programming in this case.*  
I think mnemonic skills have a lot of potential if used in a proper way. I want to properly experiment it in the next project.

1. *Make the prinicples of ultralearning and some other principles I came up with into habits.* 
   1. *Directness(& Drill/Deliberate Practice): I will start with testing before reading, with aid of QB method after breifly reading through.*  
      I think this is the most important. Mindless reading is not helping at all. I'm still more used to reading books instead of thinking and actually doing things. I think I need some extreme ways to ensure this.
      Taking a rough image is not the same as going over fast. It's essential to check what I remember always.
   1. *Objective Assessment and Feedback*  
      The most difficult part is that there is no easy way to check my understanding. And it took quite a time to come up with not good enough ones. If it is a coding assignment, it is easy. Code and run to see the expected results. But how do I quantify my understanding of what I read? I've searched for some suggestions, such as explaining to others, making real things based on it, and taking tests. But those seem not to be specific enough for me and not always applicable. I guess my next task is to find a proper way to handle this.  
      - *Always come up with specific problems or assignments that I can't cheat my understanding.*
      - *Need to be able to tell if I failed or succeeded with explicit(quantative if possible) standards.*
      - *Try again until I can meet the standards.*
      - *Always be specific in terms of memorizing and recalling.*  
   1. *Intensive Goals: Set tight deadlines and above-average standard goals to get out of comfort zone.*  
      I don't think it's necessary. I will be slower if I don't do things the way I'd been doing and probably feel awkward. It's true that good enough standard is required all the time though.
   1. *Don't Force Myself or Push Too Hard*  
      I have a personal curiosity about this: People say motivation and not being burned out is important. In physical cases, it's true. I can't study more if I'm too sleepy or dazed for some reason. However, in mental cases I don't think so. If one is having too much trouble with mental skills, it's either it's just that the person is overwhelmed and not thinking properly. We are all constantly thinking but we don't get tired from it. It seems to me that most fatigue is coming from bad posture and eye strain. I want to see what happens to me if I study for all day for a long time, but only with proper physical rests. Learning is what I like to do over other things anyway. I just need to find a way not to get distracted.
      - *Adjust the learning activity what I like to do, instead of pushing myself to the most efficient/effective way. Try to use any psychological concepts(e.g. neuroticism, self-esteem, personality) that might help to reward myself.*
      - *Use only 8-10 hours a day for studying. Fully rest on Sundays.*
   1. *Efficient Time Use*  
      As for the time used on planning, I think the problem is the absence of the system as always. And as for repeating questions, if the questions are repeated, it is either I didn't remember the answer well enough or I didn't have it at all. The solution is pretty clear: answer the question even if that's not perfect then memorize the answer.
      - *Focus on actual learning when studying instead of planning what to learn next and researching for learning materials.*
      - *Always make specific plans and tasks so that my brain can know what to do exactly.*
      - *Don't repeat asking the same questions. If found, try different questions instead.*
   1. *~~Problem Solving Process:~~ This is not really applicable for this project.*  
      It's important to note that reading and recalling are totally different process. We need to come up with connections when recalling whereas when reading they are given usually in a form of temporal and spaitial proximity, which are not really useful for recalling. And I'm sure I can find some effective patterns for retrievals then read according to those.

# How Close I Got to The Original Goals
1. 자바 완전 정복  
I've reached the level that I can understand the code written in Java with some references. So I think that's quite enough for now considering that I'm not sure if I am going to use Java as a main language.

3. 성낙현의 JSP 자바 웹 프로그래밍  
I've learned the basic structure of online forum in MVC pattern. The most important part is to divide functions into modules that each module is as independent of each other as possible to assure maintainability and scalability. Plus, I have researched some functionalities using cookies like login/logout, popup control. I don't think I know it well enough to code right now but at least now I know where to start and what to look for if there's certain problem.

3. 자바 웹 프로그래밍 Next Step  
I've only finished part of chapter 2. It seems to help a lot to know what kind of questions and objectives are essential to code better. However, it also seems that it requires a lot of practices to learn. I'll keep learning it little by little throughout this year.  
Also improving the sense is the important along with knowledge. For exmaple, code seems messy and repetitive. The thing is that there are things that I need to recognize or feel, not to think.

# Other Things I've Felt
1. It is quite hard to change the way I learn and think. I have a habit of moving on to other things when I "feel like" I understood sth and of constantly reading books and summarizing instead of actually thinking and doing things. It is the most important to get rid of these habits in the future. Also I think I have to make the whole process simpler so that I don't deviate from the original plans. And probably making habits one by one.
2. I must ensure that I think through what I learn. Or at least I can recall from the problems, not contextual information.
3. Making schedule doesn't work for me. I constantly fail to finish the plans because of the shortage of time or stall for some reason. I have to focus on getting things done instead of efficient use of time.
4. I need to do the best at the first read as I don't really enjoy re-reading and re-doing anything. Or it might be sth I need to overcome somehow.
5. I must admit that I'm not consistent or persistent now. Probably because I don't have clear goals in my mind, only written. And doubtful nature and slow rate of change as well.

# To Sum Up (Improvements to Be Made)
This is TODO in the design process for long term plan, not necessarily regarding intensive learning but general plans about learning and life.
