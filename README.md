# About The Project
An intensive study project inspired by Scott H. Young. About 2 Week-long project prior to the actual ultralearning project planned to start in September. Casually experimenting and practicing basic skills.

# What I Want to Try
1. Develop an effective way to use mnemonics skills to the actual learning, specifically programming in this case.
1. Make the prinicples of ultralearning and some other principles I came up with into habits.
   1. ~~Directness(& Drill/Deliberate Practice)~~ Not sure if I can apply this to this project for now.
   1. Objective Assessment and Feedback
      - Always come up with specific problems or assignments that I can't cheat my understanding.
      - Need to be able to tell if I failed or succeeded with explicit(quantative if possible) standards.
      - Try again until I can meet the standards.
      - Always be specific in terms of memorizing and recalling.
   1. Intensive Goals: Set tight deadlines and above-average standard goals to get out of comfort zone.
   1. Don't Force Myself or Push Too Hard
      - Adjust the learning activity what I like to do, instead of pushing myself to the most efficient/effective way. Try to use any psychological concepts(e.g. neuroticism, self-esteem, personality) that might help to reward myself.
      - Use only 8-10 hours a day for studying. Fully rest on Sundays.
   1. Efficient Time Use
      - Focus on actual learning when studying instead of planning what to learn next and researching for learning materials.
      - Always make specific plans and tasks so that my brain can know what to do exactly.
      - Don't repeat asking the same questions. If found, try different questions instead.
   1. ~~Problem Solving Process:~~ This is not really applicable for this project.
      
# Core Mnemonics Concepts
1. Mental Image
   - Images should be interactive, not just being there.
   - Vivid and clear images are recommended.
1. Retrieval Strategy
   - The more consistent throughout the same topic, the better.
   - Recalling always should be guided by the actual problem solving process or fundamental ideas/questions of the topic. Not just exploring around the mind palace. This means that how we define and approach the task/problem/question is critical to the retrieval.
   - It is a mental image itself that should be memorized. I prefer to call it a meta-knowledge.
   - Always good to check if I can infer this from what I already know.
1. Encoding and Compression
   - Mental images should be encoded in a way that a retrieval strategy itself can induce most of the images.
   - It should not depend on the current specific status, like what I have seen and heard recently. Probably only on the meta-knowledge and tasks themselves.
   - Images themselves should contain enough information to give specific and relavant information. There should be no ambiguity to interpret it in another way. 
   - Finding patterns rather than blindly memorizing is better, probably through abstraction and generalization.
   - One image can mean multiple things depending on how to interpret it. A shadow of the cylinder can be both a rectangle and a circle.
   
# General Goals and Methodology (Why, What, and How in Ultralearning)
*Concrete goals, assessing criteria, and an archiving template will be included in each according directory.*
~~Basically, I want to find out if trying to memorize books but in an effective and efficient way is enough to actually learn to use the knowledge in the books. I have three books about Java: <자바 완전 정복 (이지스 퍼블리싱)>, <성낙현의 JSP 자바 웹 프로그래밍 (골든래빗)>, <자바 웹 프로그래밍 Nest Step (로드북)>. To be fair, I have some basic knowledge about OOP and web so I don't think it would be hard for me to see the big picture while focusing on memorizing. Efficiency will be measured by the number of mental images that I use to memorize, and effectiveness will be measured by solving problmes and recalling the code in the books correctly with my own retrieval/thinking strategies.~~[^1]

1. 자바 완전 정복 (ETC: 3 days)
   - Why: Before moving on to actual programming, I wanted check my understanding of OOP. And since it has been almost five years I learned Java, I thought quick review of syntax could be nice as well.
   - What: Syntax, concepts, root problem.
   - How: For syntax, I'll organize it in a way that accords with actual need in a text file. For the others, I will find the root problem and solving ideas of each concept and try to formalize the ideas into the concepts.
   I'll try to explain before reading if I have already heard about it. If all I explained is contained in the way I imagined, I will skip that topic. If not, I will make a thought process that can naturally induce the information and memorize the process with mnemonic techniques.
   
3. 성낙현의 JSP 자바 웹 프로그래밍 (ETC: 5 days)
	- Why: I wanted to see the source codes of the basic functionalities for the back-end with detailed explanations. The book contained example codes of web applications like online forum, IM, and email sending program. But I read that JSP are not frequently used anymore. So I will focus on making abstractions of functionalities and the basic concepts beneath them.
	- What: Syntax, models of the server, sample codes
	- How: In the first reading, I will go from the start to the end summarizing the language-specific features, and generalizing the overall model and concepts regarding the server, which I will memorize using mnemonics. Next, I will make review problems using the examples in the book to evaluate my understanding. If needed, I will read again some particular parts of the book, not the entire book. Then I will solve the review problems to check my mental model.

4. 자바 웹 프로그래밍 Next Step (ETC: 7 days)
	- Why: I wanted to synchronize my coding process to the actual programmer.
	- What: .
	- How: As the author encourages doing before learning, I am going to follow that. And I will compare my thought process and code to the author's, trying to synchronize with them.
