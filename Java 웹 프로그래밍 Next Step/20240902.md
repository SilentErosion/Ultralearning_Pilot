<!--
Why: I wanted to know what I have to consider when I code and how to develop those ideas into code.
What: Evaluation critieria for the good code, common practices
How: As the author encourages doing before learning, I am going to do that. That means no reading through, just from the beginning to the end not going further before trying and understanding.
Also, I'm going to abstract and image the 'what' above to remember and use in the future.

# Concrete Goals and Evaluation Criteria
<!-- 
1. Make it fun.
2. Make it specific, measurable, provable.
3. Make it last.
-->
I'm not feeling very well today so I'll keep it to the minimum. The main goal is to reflect on what I've learned yesterday.
- [x] List the things I have to learn or search further
- [x] Refactor yesterday's code and compare to the example code in the book: Conciseness, readability, reusability.
- [x] Implement spec2 or more: Clearly define small independent problems and do the tests. Rationalize the design of the tests.

I wrote test code upto 6 and skipped 7 because it seemed to be a mere write operation.  
The tests were designed so that the dummy input is given, which could be directly obtained from the request or easily obtained with the methods written before.  
I think there are few things I can refactor to enhance reusability. And it will be clear if I got all right when I actually implement all the specs in main method, then test the main method.

# Archiving Template
The main points are not to cheat myself that I understood when I actually didn't, and review my thought process. So try to include at least these:
### 1. The approaches/strategies I used and why
### 2. The proof that I reached the goal
### 3. If not, what I did to make amends + re-evaluation till I do.
