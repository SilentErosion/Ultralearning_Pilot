<!--
Why: I wanted to know what I have to consider when I code and how to develop those ideas into code.
What: Evaluation critieria for the good code, common practices
How: As the author encourages doing before learning, I am going to do that. That means no reading through, just from the beginning to the end not going further before trying and understanding.
Also, I'm going to abstract and image the 'what' above to remember and use in the future.

# Concrete Goals and Evaluation Criteria
<!-- 
1. Make it fun.
2. Make it specific, measurable, provable.
3. Make it last.
-->
- [x] 1. Make clear of problem definitions and approaches. Write down the core questions and answers on the book, think about them and draw conclusions:
      I think I'll automatically check my understanding if I keep studying with the book as the key concepts would be repeated.
      So for now, make review questions and try to solve them mostly with what I learned at the moment.
- [ ] 2. Keep on learning - "Do" and remember as much as I can:
      Do what the book suggests and compare the results. Think about what I missed. Memorize the key information using mnemonics. Retrieve and evaluate the images to improve them.

# Archiving Template
The main points are not to cheat myself that I understood when I actually didn't, and review my thought process. So try to include at least these:
### 1. The approaches/strategies I used and why
### 2. The proof that I reached the goal
### 3. If not, what I did to make amends + re-evaluation till I do.

1. Chapter1 Simple String Calculator
   1. Throwable vs Exception
      Throwable class is a parent class of Exception class. Using a parent class is not wrong but I guess using Exception is more specific and accurate.
   2. Throws vs Throw
      Throw actually generates exception objects. Whereas Throws represents try block in a form of method. E.g.
      ```
      int divide(int a, int b) throws ArithmeticException {
        return a / b;
      }
      ```
	 3. Reflections
      The fact that my original code was quite similar to the example answer means that the overall process is pretty same up to this point. So I decided to skip most of objective 1.
