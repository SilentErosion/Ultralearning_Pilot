<!--
Why: I wanted to know what I have to consider when I code and how to develop those ideas into code.
What: Evaluation critieria for the good code, common practices
How: As the author encourages doing before learning, I am going to do that. That means no reading through, just from the beginning to the end not going further before trying and understanding.
Also, I'm going to abstract and image the 'what' above to remember and use in the future.

# Concrete Goals and Evaluation Criteria
<!-- 
1. Make it fun.
2. Make it specific, measurable, provable.
3. Make it last.
-->
- [ ] 1. "Do" and remember as much as I can: Do what the book suggests and compare the results. Think about what I missed.  
      Memorize the key information using mnemonics. Retrieve and evaluate the images to improve them.

# Archiving Template
The main points are not to cheat myself that I understood when I actually didn't, and review my thought process. So try to include at least these:
### 1. The approaches/strategies I used and why
### 2. The proof that I reached the goal
### 3. If not, what I did to make amends + re-evaluation till I do.
